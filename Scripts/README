When it's time to release a new version, here's what needs to be done:

1. asses the current marketing version and build number:
    ./Version.sh

2. bump the build number:
    ./Version.sh -b

3. tag the current version:
    git tag vX.Y.Z (eg: git tag v1.2.3)

4. set the new marketing version:
    ./Version.sh -s --plist-path Emotly

Also, don't forget to push --tags next time.
Then you're free to release.:)
